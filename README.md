# InternshipProject

### This README is about my **Internship Project for Valtech**. 
###### The project contains the main page: index.html and some of my projects that are connected with the webpage.
Index.html contains navigation bar with the following links: **Home, About Me, Skills, My CV and Projects**. Also in the navigation bar you can find my links from Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and GitHub.
The navigation bar is `fixed-top`. By scrolling down the page you can find the Home, About Me, Skills and My CV sections or by clicking in the navigation bar.
In the attached files you can also find MyStyle.css, with my custom css for some efects, hover tools, colors and etc. In the folder Projects you can see some of my projects that are connected with the webpage. 
Thank you for your time and I hope you will like my project.
